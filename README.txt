This is where I am going to store some Python practice for new things that I learn.
StripRegex.py-
This is my practice using Regex, which is creating a strip() function manually. It works with the exception of "\".

steganography.py-
For a final project in a Computer Science course the class chose what to work on, and I chose to make a steganography program. Takes an PNG and a txt, encodes the message within a copy of a PNG and saves it. The program can also read PNGs that were encoded with the same method. One major bug is some PNGs look messed up when encoded, and I think that has to do with how a PNG has transperencies like how a PNG of a character isn't surrounded by white or black color. I never accounted for that when I made this.
